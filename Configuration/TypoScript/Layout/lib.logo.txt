# The method used here to fetch a record from a page or folder is slightly different from the one used
# to fetch the loginbox in lib.contentleft
# The method here doesn't refer to a specific record but takes the first record from the folder. This
# has the advantage that an editor can delete the record and just create a new one, and it still works.
